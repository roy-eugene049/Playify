# Playify
Music player that takes descriptions of notes and chords, then plays them live on your computer. Made with Lua. Lua is a table-based programming language, built on a single powerful abstraction that you can use to implement your own programming styleâ€”procedural, object-oriented, event-driven, and so on.
